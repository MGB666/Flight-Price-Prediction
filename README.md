# Flight-Price-Prediction

As a part of my flight price prediction project, I am focusing on the route between Delhi and Mumbai. An airline company provides air transport services for passengers and freight using aircraft, and they assign prices to their services to maximize profitability. The pricing of airline tickets is affected by several factors such as flight duration, days left for departure, arrival time, and departure time, among others. To predict the flight prices between Delhi and Mumbai, I will be using Machine Learning (ML) to infer the proprietary rules and algorithms that set the price. Through this project, I aim to build a model that can accurately predict the flight prices between Delhi and Mumbai based on historical data, thereby helping travelers to plan their trip more efficiently and save money.


This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict flight prices based on historical data and Statistical Analysis of the data using Pandas. The project is implemented using Python, and the machine learning models are trained using the scikit-learn and XGBoost library.

## Data 

The data used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle Flight Price Prediction dataset ('Clean_Dataset.csv') Year 2022 , which includes historical flight prices and information such as departure and arrival times, airline, and number of stops.

But for this project, I only wanted to use two different cities so I edited the csv file and created a new edited version which only includes Delhi(source_city) and Mumbai(destination_city) , ('Clean_Dataset.csv1') .
